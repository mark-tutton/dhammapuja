    [10:55.0]   [N^ow let us chant our salutation to the T`riple Gem and a passage of encouragement.]
    [11:03.4] (Buddho s`usuddho) k`aruṇāmah^aṇṇavo
    [11:11.2]   The B`uddha, absolute`ly pure, with ^ocean-like comp`assion,
    [11:18.0] Yoccant`a-suddhabb`ara-ñāṇ`a-loc`ano
    [11:23.7]   Possessing th`e clear sight of w`isdom,
    [11:27.3] Lokass`a pāpūp`ak^iles`a-ghāt`ako
    [11:32.8]   Destroyer `of worldly self-corr^uption
    [11:36.8] Vandām^i buddhaṃ `ah^am-ād`aren`a taṃ
    [11:42.3]   Devot^edly `indeed, that Buddha ^I r`evere.
    [11:47.2] Dhammo p`adīpo v`iya tass`a satth`uno
    [11:52.4]   The Teaching of th`e Lord, like `a lamp,
    [11:56.2] Yo magg^apākām`at`a-bhed`a-bhinn`ako
    [12:01.7]   Illuminating th`e Path and its Fruit: the D`eathless,
    [12:07.0] Lokuttaro yo c`a t`adatth`a-dīp`ano
    [12:12.3]   That which is bey^ond the conditioned world—
    [12:16.0] Vandām^i dhammaṃ `ah^am-ād`aren`a taṃ
    [12:21.6]   Devot^edly `indeed, that Dhamma ^I r`evere.
    [12:26.3] S^aṅgho s`ukhettābhyati-kh`etta-s^aññito
    [12:31.7]   Th`e Sangha, the m`ost fertile gr^ound for cultiv`ation,
    [12:37.0] Yo diṭṭh^asanto s`ug`atān`ubodh`ako
    [12:42.2]   Those who have real`ised Peace, awakened after th`e Acc^omplished One,
    [12:48.9] Lolapp`ahīno `ar^iyo s`umedh`aso
    [12:54.3]   N^oble `and wise, all longing ab`andoned—
    [12:58.5] Vandām^i saṅghaṃ `ah^am-ād`aren`a taṃ
    [13:04.5]   Devot^edly `indeed, that Sangha ^I r`evere.
    [13:09.0] Iccevam-ekant`abh^ipūj`a-neyy`akaṃ
    [13:14.0]   This salutation should b`e made,
    [13:17.4] Vatthuttayaṃ vand`ay`atābh`isaṅkh`ataṃ
    [13:22.7]   To th^at which is w`orthy.
    [13:25.0] Puññaṃ m`ayā yaṃ m`am`a sabb`upadd`avā
    [13:30.5]   Through th`e power of s`uch good ^action,
    [13:34.0] Mā h^ont`u ve tass`a p`abhāv`asiddh`iyā
    [13:39.4]   May `all obstacles d^is`appear.
    [13:42.7] Idha tath^āgato loke `uppanno `arahaṃ sammāsambuddho
    [13:51.6]   One who knows things as th`ey are has come int^o this world; and he is an `Arahant, `a perfectly Aw^akened being.
    [14:03.7] Dhammo c`a des`ito niyyān`iko `up`as`amiko p`arinibbān`iko s^ambodh`agāmī s`ug`atapp`aved`ito
    [14:17.0]   Purifying th`e way leading `out `of d`el`usion, calming and d`irecting to p^erfect peace, and leading to enl`ightenment — this Way he h^as m`ade known.
    [14:31.5] M^ayantaṃ dhammaṃ s`utvā evaṃ jānāma
    [14:37.5]   Having heard th`e Teaching, we kn`ow this:
    [14:41.5] Jātip`i dukkhā
    [14:43.8]   Birth is d`ukkha,
    [14:45.7] Jarāp`i dukkhā
    [14:48.0]   Ageing is d`ukkha,
    [14:50.1] M`araṇamp`i dukkhaṃ

    [14:55.0] S^oka-p`arideva-dukkh`a-domanass`upāyās^āp`i d`ukkhā
    [15:02.5]   S^orrow, l`amentation, pain, grief, and d`espair are d`ukkha.
    [15:08.0] Appiyeh`i s^amp`ayogo dukkho
    [15:12.5]   Assoc^iation with th^e d`isliked is d`ukkha,
    [15:16.8] Piyeh`i v^ipp`ayogo dukkho
    [15:21.0]   Sep^aration from th`e liked is d`ukkha,
    [15:24.5] Yampiccha^ṃ n`a labhati tamp`i dukkhaṃ
    [15:29.0]   Not attaining ones w^ishes is d`ukkha.
    [15:32.5] S^aṅkhittena pañc`upādānakkh^andhā dukkhā
    [15:38.8]   In brief, the five focuses of the gr^asping mind are d`ukkha.
    [15:44.5] Seyy`athīdaṃ
    [15:46.5]   These are as f`ollows:
    [15:49.5] Rūpūpādān`akkh^andho
    [15:52.8]   Identification with the b`ody,
    [15:56.0] Vedanūpādān`akkh^andho

    [16:20.8]   Identification with c^onsc`iousness.
    [16:24.2] Yesaṃ p`ariññāya
    [16:27.3]   For the c`omplete underst^anding of this,
    [16:30.9] Dh`aramāno s^o bh`agavā
    [16:34.4]   Th`e Blessed One in his l`ifetime
    [16:37.7] Evaṃ b`ahulaṃ s^āv`ake v`ineti
    [16:42.4]   Frequently `instructed his disc^iples in just th`is way.
    [16:47.0] Evaṃ bhāgā c`a panassa bh`agav`ato s^āv`akesu `anus^ās`anī b`ahulā p`avatt`ati
    [16:58.0]   In addition, he f`urth`er `instr`ucted:
    [17:01.8] Rūpaṃ `aniccaṃ
    [17:04.3]   The body is imp`ermanent,
    [17:07.0] Vedanā `aniccā
    [17:10.0]   Feeling is imp`ermanent,
    [17:12.5] S^aññā `aniccā

    [17:27.4]   C^onsciousness is imp`ermanent;
    [17:30.3] Rūpaṃ `anattā
    [17:33.0]   The body is n`ot-self,
    [17:35.3] Vedanā `anattā
    [17:38.3]   Feeling is n`ot-self,
    [17:40.5] Saññā `anattā
    [17:43.0]   Perc^eption is n`ot-self,
    [17:45.5] S^aṅkh^ārā `anattā
    [17:48.7]   Mental formations are n`ot-self,
    [17:52.0] Viññānaṃ `anattā
    [17:55.0]   C^onsciousness is n`ot-self;
    [17:57.3] S`abbe s^aṅkh^ārā `aniccā
    [18:01.5]   All conditions are impermanent,
    [18:04.5] S`abbe dhammā `anattā ti
    [18:08.7]   There is n`o self in the cr`eated or the `uncre^ated.
    [18:14.0] Te m^ayaṃ
    [18:15.9]   All of us
    [18:17.7] Otiṇṇāmha-jāt`iyā j`arāmaraṇena
    [18:23.3]   Are bound `by birth, ageing, `and death,
    [18:27.0] S^okehi p`arideveh`i dukkh^eh`i domanasseh`i `upāyāsehi
    [18:36.2]   By s^orrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and d`espair,
    [18:41.4] Dukkh^otiṇṇā dukkh`ap`aretā
    [18:45.6]   B^ound by dukkha and obstr`uct`ed by d`ukkha.
    [18:49.8] Appevanām^imass`a kevalass`a dukkhakkhandhass`a ant`akir^iyā paññāyethā ti
    [19:01.0]   Let us all `aspire to c`omplete fr^eedom from s`uffering.
    [19:06.6] C^ir^aparinibbutamp^itaṃ bh`agav^antaṃ saraṇaṃ g`atā
    [19:13.7]   The Blessed One, who long ago attained Parinibb^āna, is our refuge.
    [19:20.4] Dh^ammañca S^aṅghañca
    [19:23.2]   So too are the Dh^amma and the S`angha.
    [19:27.0] Tassa bh`agavato s^āsanaṃ yath^āsati yath^ābalaṃ manasik`aroma `anupaṭip^ajjāma
    [19:38.1]   Attentively we f^ollow the pathway of that Bl`essed One, with _all_ of our m^indfulness `and strength.
    [19:46.8] Sā sā n`o paṭ^ipatti
    [19:50.0]   May then the cultiv^ation of this pr`actice
    [19:54.0] Imass`a kevalass`a dukkhakkh^andhass`a ant`akir^iyāya s^aṃv^att`atu
    [20:03.3]   Lead us to th`e end of ^e_very_ kind of s`uffering.
