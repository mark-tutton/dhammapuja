      [00:00.0] ### Verses of Sharing and Aspiration (Eng.)
      [00:00.9] ##### <i>from Amaravati</i>
        <hr />

      [00:02.6] [ N^ow let us chant the verses of sharing and aspir`ation. ]

      [00:07.1] Through th`e goodness that ar^ises from my pr`actice,

      [00:13.9] May `my spiritual t^eachers and g_uides_ of great v`irtue,

      [00:21.0] `My mother, my f^ather, and my r`elatives,

      [00:27.2] The Sun `and th^e Moon, and `all _virtuous_ l^eaders of th`e world,

      [00:35.6] May th`e highest gods and evil f`orces,

      [00:41.8] Cel`esti^al beings, g_uardian_ sp^irits of th`e Earth, and the L`ord ^of Death,

      [00:52.7] May _those_ wh`o are fri^endly, indifferent, or h`ostile,

      [00:59.6] May `all beings receive the bl^ess^ings of `my life,

      [01:05.0] May th`ey soon attain the thr^eef`old bliss and realize the D`eathless.

      [01:14.2] Through th`e goodness that ar^ises from my pr`actice,

      [01:20.0] And through this act of sh`aring,

      [01:24.0] May all d`esires and att^achments quick``ly cease

      [01:29.5] And `all harmful st`ates ^of mind.

      [01:34.0] Until I realize Nibbāna, <!---->

      [01:38.3] In every kind `of birth, may I h`ave an ^upr`ight mind,

      [01:45.5] W`ith mindfulness and w`isdom, aust^erity and v`igour.

      [01:52.1] May th`e forces of del^usion not t`ake hold nor weaken m``y r^esolve.

      [02:00.8] Th`e Buddha is my ^excellent r`efuge,

      [02:05.5] Uns`urpassed is the prot^ection of the Dhamm`a,

      [02:10.4] Th`e Solitary B^uddha is my n`oble lord,

      [02:15.6] Th`e Saṅgha is my supr^eme s`upport.

      [02:19.8] Through th`e supreme p^ow^er of `all these,

      [02:24.3] M`ay darkness and del^usion be d`ispelled.
